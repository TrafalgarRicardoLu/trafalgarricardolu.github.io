I am a software engineer focus on distributed storage systems. Currently, I am working at ByteDance HDFS team, where I focus on developing and optimizing distributed storage systems serving very large-scale machine learning and analytics .

Previously,I received my Master's degree in Software Engineering from the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC) in 2023 and Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Technology from Hangzhou Dianzi University (HDU) in 2020. 

I have internship experience at [PingCAP TiSpark](https://github.com/pingcap/tispark) and ByteDance (Block Storage) during 2021 - 2022. I also participated in [Google Summer of Code 2021 (GSoC)](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/archive/2021/projects/6453137933598720), working on PostgreSQL-pg_systat extensions to add various monitoring panels.

I enjoy working on distributed systems and database technologies, with a passion for building reliable, efficient, and scalable software systems.
